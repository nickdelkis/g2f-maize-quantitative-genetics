# Quantitative Genetics Analysis of Maize Using G2F Data

## Overview
This repository demonstrates complementary approaches to quantitative genetics using 
the Genomes to Fields maize dataset: genetic discovery through GWAS and phenotype 
prediction through machine learning.

## Dataset
Genomes to Fields (G2F) Initiative: 5,899 hybrid genotypes, 2,425 SNPs, 
phenotypic data from 272 environments (2014-2023).

## Projects

### 1. GWAS: Genetic Architecture of Flowering Time
- **Goal**: Identify loci associated with flowering time variation
- **Methods**: GWAS using GAPIT, 2,425 SNPs, 2022-2023 environments
- **Results**: [Summary findings]
- **[View detailed analysis →](01-gwas-flowering-time/)**

### 2. Machine Learning: Yield Prediction
- **Goal**: Predict grain yield from genomic and environmental data
- **Methods**: Random Forest and Neural Network, 673 environmental covariates
- **Results**: [Model performance]
- **[View detailed analysis →](02-ml-yield-prediction/)**

## Why Both Approaches?
In modern breeding programs, GWAS identifies causal biology while ML models 
optimize selection. This portfolio demonstrates capability in both discovery 
and application.
